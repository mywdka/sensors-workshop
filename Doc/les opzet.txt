Intro.
Basic Sensors. Often based on chemical or physical characteristic
In contrast to complex sensors (f.i. a camera, a kinect)


PART I intro / concept
-explain the idea of controlling a movie
-explain the different sensors
-let them think of an idea

PART II electronics
-how sensors work: changing resistance. (or ready made circuit)
-explain voltage on digital and analog sensors
-explain Arduino & Breadboard
-classical write arduino code
-let them hook up and test sensors

PART III programming
-explain Max
-let them open the patch and import their movie
-change arduino code to get data. 
-the idea of thresh holding
-Write a patch
